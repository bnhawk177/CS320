# CS320
I ensure my code functions by typing out five to ten lines and making sure it is correct.  If there are any errors I strive to find those and correct them before moving on to any
other frame of the code.  If I cannot ensure the lines that I just typed are not functioning, how can I create future code that will work as well.
And if I don't bother to find my errors until the end, I think I would be wasting a lot more time combing through everything to figure out where the errors are and why
is my code not producing what I need it to produce.
